This undergraduate thesis is a survey about public security and possible Data Science applications. We researched recent applications and tried our own implementation of Naive Bayes and Random Forest classificators over Secretaria da Segurança Pública do Estado de São Paulo, the institution responsable for public security in São Paulo State, Brazil. Our findings point out that these algorithms are not sufficient to classificate the data we were provided with. However, due to their fast processing time, we conclude that, with more computer power and multi modal data, excellent results could be achieved, which could contribute to a better condition in public security condition in Brazil. We also considered the ethical risks offered by this approacha in our work.
